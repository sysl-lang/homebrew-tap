  # A *runtime* dependency rather than a build one. sysl emits textual LLVM IR and
  # shells out from there: clang assembles and links it, and llvm-ar is what builds
  # a library into a .syslib. Apple's command-line tools ship a clang but no
  # llvm-ar, which is why this cannot be left to whatever is already on the machine
  # -- and why Toolchain.arCandidates already looks in /opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin.

    # The tarball is already a prefix -- bin/sysl and share/sysl/lib -- so the

    #
    # The standard library ships as source rather than being generated into the
    # binary, and the compiler finds it by resolving its own path and looking for
    # <prefix>/share/sysl/lib. That is exactly pkgshare, which is why installing
    # the tree as it stands is the whole of it: no wrapper script, no environment
    # variable, and an old keg left behind keeps using the library it shipped with.

    # or an install step that dropped it, produces a compiler that starts, answers
    # --version, and cannot compile anything.

    # Deliberately more than a smoke test of the binary starting. This drives the
    # whole toolchain: it finds the library installed above, builds the
    # standard-module artifact into the cache from it, emits IR, and hands that
    # to clang to assemble and link -- so it fails if the llvm dependency is not
    # actually reachable at runtime, which is the other way this formula could be
    # wrong and still install.
    #
    # assert_equal rather than assert_match, so this pins the *whole* of stdout
    # rather than passing on the text appearing somewhere in it. And 42 is
    # computed by the compiled program rather than echoed, so a back end that
    # got arithmetic wrong fails here instead of printing a greeting and passing.
    # The artifact-build notice goes to stderr and so is not part of this.
